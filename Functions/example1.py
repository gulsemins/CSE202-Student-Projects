#The given code defines a function make_even that takes a number as an argument and returns the next even number if the given number is odd, or the given number itself if it is even.The code also defines a set of numbers called x.
def make_even(num):
    if num%2==1:
        return num+1
    else:
        return num
    
x = [125,642,123,562,689,934,900,741]

def map_make_even(make_even,x):
    y=[]
    for num in x:
        y.append(make_even(num))
    print(y)  

#The map_make_even function is therefore defined as a higher-order function that accepts two arguments: the make_even function and the x list. Using a for loop and the append method, this function applies the make_even function to each element in the x list and returns a new list y containing the modified elements.

map_make_even(make_even, x)

#Finally, the map_make_even function is called with the make_even function and x list as arguments, and the resulting list y is printed to the console using the print function.
